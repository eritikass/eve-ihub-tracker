its quite raw dump for what i collected from server, just was thinking to share in case anyone interested or wanting to dev this future (big sov changes coming)

there

SQL_*.zip are basically all eve dump tables - however they may be modified/renamed a bit (not sure - need to check ... added those to get it working easy if anyone want)

dumb.sql <--- various custom tables made / used by this script - probably most note worthy is mapSolarSystems_beltinfo what is made using ccp dump - if i remeber correctly this ice info is based for some older dumb

rest should be quite self explaing, if any issues (or anything missing) please be free to post here questions or mail ingame
